🟢 Simple & Practical Suggestions to Improve System Effectiveness

These are written in plain terms evaluators will appreciate.

✅ 1) Improve how the system understands user queries

Right now, the system uses:

rule-based parsing

fixed keywords

structured mapping

To make it smarter:

⭐ Add synonyms & variations

engineering → dev → development
orders → sales → transactions
price above → greater than → more than


⭐ Add basic spell-check tolerance

⭐ (Future) Add optional LLM fallback
(for complex queries only)

This keeps system fast, safe, and offline — but upgrade-ready.

✅ 2) Improve search result relevance

Currently results are based on:

SQL filters

tf-idf similarity

We can improve by:

⭐ Adding a relevance score

Final Score = SQL Match + Semantic Match Weight


⭐ Prioritize:

exact matches first

close meaning matches next

⭐ Display “why this result appeared”

(example: matched department name)

This increases explainability & user trust.

✅ 3) Improve Streamlit UI usability

Make it friendlier & more interactive:

⭐ Show SQL query preview (read-only)

⭐ Add query history sidebar

⭐ Allow saving frequently used queries

⭐ Add tooltips like:

“Semantic match applied”

“Filter by salary > X”

⭐ Optionally show match score %

Makes the tool feel polished & professional.

✅ 4) Improve code structure & maintainability

Refactor into clean modules:

nlp_parser.py — query interpretation

sql_templates.py — safe SQL patterns

hybrid_search.py — semantic search logic

db.py — database layer

Also add:

✔ comments & docstrings
✔ type hints
✔ basic unit tests
✔ logging for executed SQL paths

Easier to debug, extend, and review.

✅ 5) Improve database & sample data quality

Add:

⭐ more realistic employee records
⭐ multiple departments
⭐ more order history
⭐ price variations in products

Also add:

✔ test queries set
✔ sample outputs table

This improves demo quality & evaluation strength.

🏆 Evaluation Criteria — Explained in Simple Terms

Here’s how your system meets expectations 👇

🎯 Query Accuracy & Efficiency

✔ Rule-based SQL = predictable & correct
✔ Semantic search improves meaning-based matches
✔ Works fast because everything runs locally
✔ pgvector speeds up similarity search

🎯 Usability of Streamlit UI

✔ Clean single-input query box
✔ Simple readable results table
✔ Suitable for demo & evaluation
✔ Easy to understand for non-technical users

(And future UI upgrades already suggested)

🎯 Best Strategy Suggestions for Improvement

✔ Hybrid rule-based + semantic search
✔ LLM only as optional addon
✔ relevance-based ranking
✔ explainable results
✔ feedback-driven enhancements
